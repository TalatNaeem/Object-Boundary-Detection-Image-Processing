# Objects-and-Boundry-Detection (DIP)
A functionality of Open CV to detect the objects &amp; drawing boundaries around an object or removing some objects from a given image to restore some critical information. If we want to detect an object in the image or want to remove something least important from the given image we can do with the help of come which I am going to give in thius repository.
And with the help of that you will be able to not only detect an object but also draw boundries around them.

## Description
This is my assignment of Digital Imgae Processing course which consist of four different questions. Read more about it <a href="https://github.com/TalatNaeem/Object-Boundary-Detection-Image-Processing/report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The detail of all these questions will be as follows:
- **Q1:** In this question we are given an image having two white objects with black background and they are having an overlapping area which we have to find in this questions. All the details are written in the report and code with detailed comments also available there in the repository.
